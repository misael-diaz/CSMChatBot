# AI_Agent_CSM
This project involves the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) agent capable of generating required files for molecular simulations and analysis. 

### Instructions

1. Open the .env file and paste your OpenAI API key.

2. Go to the chatbot_tutorial folder and run the "ConversationalBot_Tutorial.ipynb" notebook to learn how to run a general chatbot.

3. Then, learn about simple agents by running the "SimpleAgent_Tutorial.ipynb" notebook.

4. open the chatbot_tutorial/streamlit folder and run the "StreamLit_tutorial.py" script to launch the streamlit application.
  - command: streamlit run StreamLit_tutorial.py

4. Inside the streamlit script, load the different chatbots or agents by importing them in lines 10-12. Additionally, change the behavior of the response function in lines 52-58.

Use these agents and tools as guides to code your agents with personalized tasks.
